                As a software engineer here I've done most of my work in 
                <a href="https://samara.com/" target="_blank">Samara</a>, 
                an R&amp;D division within Airbnb. I spent a lot of time doing backend work (Python/Django) 
                as well as frontend work (Javascript/Vue). However, this year I'm back to doing mostly iOS work.

                Unfortunately due to the confidential nature of this project I can't share any product images, 
                but here are a few photos of me hosting an internal employee experience. It was called 
                <i>An Afternoon with the Piano</i> where I held a brief music workshop followed by a 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B2F5ZU0nRiv/" target="_blank">performance</a> 
                of some of my 
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B796isrnYQK/" target="_blank">favorite </a>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/COG2aWxnIFy/" target="_blank">piano </a>
                <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B5jJvbDnCFh/" target="_blank">pieces</a>.
                Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
