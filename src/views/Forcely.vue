                provided code enforcement officers with a quick and easy way to log their day to day activities.

                This is a company I started in 2018 to reduce the amount of inefficiencies in 
                local government. I conducted research, designed, and built the entire app myself using Googleâ€™s 
                <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/" target="_blank">Firestore</a> 
                as the back-end. I also built a web dashboard in 
                <a href="https://angular.io/" target="blank">angular</a> 
                to accompany the iOS app. This allowed city supervisors to gain 
                insights into the activities their code enforcement officers were logging.
            </p>

                I've since closed this business, but I did have one 
                <a href="https://goo.gl/Pv5rj7" target="_blank"> city</a> 
                using the platform for a while.
