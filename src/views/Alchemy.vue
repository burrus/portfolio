                was an iOS app that served as a chat-based client for 
                <a href="https://openai.com/" target="_blank">OpenAI</a>'s 
                 GPT-3 and GPT-4 models. In late 2022, following the launch of the ChatGPT
                web version, I decided to create this iOS app to deepen my understanding of 
                the underlying technology. It proved to be a valuable learning experience 
                and garnered several thousand downloads on the App Store. However, with the 
                launch of OpenAIâ€™s official iOS app, I decided to shut down Alchemy.
